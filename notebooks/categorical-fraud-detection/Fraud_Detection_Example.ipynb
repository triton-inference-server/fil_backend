    "# Fraud Detection with XGBoost and Triton-FIL\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this example notebook, we will go step-by-step through the process of training and deploying an XGBoost fraud detection model using Triton's new FIL backend. Along the way, we'll show how to analyze the performance of a model deployed in Triton and optimize its performance based on specific SLA targets or other considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook includes some code to train an XGBoost model, the focus is primarily on how to _use_ that model with Triton. For more general information on XGBoost model training, see the [official XGBoost tutorials](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-Requisites\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you have Docker and libb64 plus a few Python dependencies. To install all Python dependencies in a conda environment, you may make use of the following conda environment file:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "### XGBoost 1.6\n",

    "## A Note on Categorical Variables\n",
    "Categorical variable support was added to the Triton FIL backend in release 21.12 and to XGBoost in release 1.5. If you would like to use an earlier version of either of these or if you simply wish to see how the same workflow would go without explicit categorical variable support, you may set the `USE_CATEGORICAL` variable in the following cell to `False`. Otherwise, by leaving it as `True`, you can take advantage of categorical variable support.\n",

In the following steps, we make use of cuML's preprocessing tools to clean the data and then train two example models using XGBoost. Note that we will be making use of the new categorical feature support in XGBoost 1.5. If you wish to use an earlier version of XGBoost, you will need to perform a [label encoding](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuml/stable/api.html?highlight=labelencoder#cuml.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.LabelEncoder) on the categorical features."

    "### The Configuration File\n",
    "The configuration file associated with a model tells Triton a little bit about the model itself and how you would like to use it. You can read about all generic Triton configuration options [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md) and about configuration options specific to the FIL backend [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/fil_backend#configuration), but we will focus on just a few of the most common and relevant options in this example. Below are general descriptions of these options:\n",
    "- **max_batch_size**: The maximum batch size that can be passed to this model. In general, the only limit on the size of batches passed to a FIL backend is the memory available with which to process them. For GPU execution, the available memory is determined by the size of Triton's CUDA memory pool, which can be set via a command line argument when starting the server.\n",
    "- **input**: Options in this section tell Triton the number of features to expect for each input sample.\n",
    "- **output**: Options in this section tell Triton how many output values there will be for each sample. If the \"predict_proba\" option (described further on) is set to true, then a probability value will be returned for each class. Otherwise, a single value will be returned indicating the class predicted for the given sample.\n",
    "- **instance_group**: This determines how many instances of this model will be created and whether they will use the GPU or CPU.\n",
    "- **model_type**: A string indicating what format the model is in (\"xgboost_json\" in this example, but \"xgboost\", \"lightgbm\", and \"tl_checkpoint\" are valid formats as well).\n",
    "- **predict_proba**: If set to true, probability values will be returned for each class rather than just a class prediction.\n",
    "- **output_class**: True for classification models, false for regression models.\n",
    "- **threshold**: A score threshold for determining classification. When output_class is set to true, this must be provided, although it will not be used if predict_proba is also set to true.\n",
    "- **storage_type**: In general, using \"AUTO\" for this setting should meet most usecases. If \"AUTO\" storage is selected, FIL will load the model using either a sparse or dense representation based on the approximate size of the model. In some cases, you may want to explicitly set this to \"SPARSE\" in order to reduce the memory footprint of large models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this information, let's set up configuration files for our models."

Some of these optimizations depend on expected server load and whether inference requests will be submitted in batches or one at a time from clients. As we shall see, Triton's performance analysis tools allow you to test performance based on a wide range of anticipated scenarios and modify deployment parameters accordingly.\n",

We'll start with a basic comparison of the performance of our large model deployed on CPU vs GPU with batch size 1 and no concurrency.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this example notebook, we showed how to deploy an XGBoost model in Triton using the new FIL backend. While it is possible to deploy these models on both CPU and GPU in Triton, GPU-deployed models offer far higher throughput at lower latency. As a result, we can deploy more sophisticated models on the GPU for any given latency budget and thereby obtain far more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have focused on XGBoost in this example, FIL also natively supports LightGBM's text serialization format as well as Treelite's checkpoint format. Thus, the same general steps can be used to serve LightGBM models and any Treelite-convertible model (including Scikit-Learn and cuML forest models). With the new FIL backend, Triton is now ready to serve forest models of all kinds in production, whether on their own or in concert with any of the deep-learning models supported by Triton."
