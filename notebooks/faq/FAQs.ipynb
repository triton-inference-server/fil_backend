    "# The FIL Backend for Triton: FAQs and Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook focuses on the technical details of deploying tree-based models with the FIL Backend for Triton. It is organized as a series of FAQs followed by example code providing a practical illustration of the corresponding FAQ section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to offer information that goes beyond the basics and provide answers to practical questions that may arise when attempting a real-world deployment with the FIL backend. If you are a complete newcomer to the FIL backend and are looking for a short introduction to the basics of what the FIL backend is and how to use it, you are encouraged to check out [this introductory notebook](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/fil_backend/blob/main/notebooks/categorical-fraud-detection/Fraud_Detection_Example.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "While we do provide training code for example models, training models is *not* the subject of this notebook, and we will provide little detail on training. Instead, you are encouraged to use your own model(s) and data with this notebook to get a realistic picture of how your model will perform with Triton."

    "# FAQ 4: My models are exhausting Triton's memory. What can I do?\n",
    "Tree-based models tend to have fairly modest memory needs, but when using several models together or when trying to process very large batches, you'll sometimes run into memory constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "For models deployed on GPU, Triton allocates a device memory pool when it is launched, and the FIL backend only allocates device memory from this pool, so one option is to simply increase the size of the pool until you reach hardware limits on available memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For models deployed on CPU or for deployments which have exceeded the hardware limits on available device memory, you may wish to instead reduce the memory consumption of models by tweaking configuration options. Let's look at this case first to showcase the polling mode introduced in the previous example. [^](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "## FAQ 4.1 How can I decrease the memory consumed by a model?\n",
    "There are two primary ways to reduce memory consumption by a FIL model:\n",
    "- Reducing max batch size\n",
    "- Changing the `storage_type` option to use a low-memory model representation\n",
    "We will take a look at both of these options in the next example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that reducing `max_batch_size` in `config.pbtxt` will only impact memory consumption if your model is receiving large enough batches to run up against this limit. Keep in mind that with Triton's dynamic batching feature, there is a distinction between *client* batch size and *server* batch size. With dynamic batching enabled, several small batches received from one or more clients can be combined into a larger server batch. The `max_batch_size` configuration option sets the maximum *server* batch that your model will receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most deployments, the more consistent way to reduce model memory usage is to change the `storage_type` option. FIL gives models an in-memory representation of type `DENSE`, `SPARSE`, or `SPARSE8`, in order of progressively less memory usage. Note that using a `SPARSE` or `SPARSE8` representation can reduce a model's runtime performance and that some models will fail to load as `SPARSE8`. In general, `SPARSE8` should be avoided unless absolutely necessary for memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting `storage_type` to `AUTO`, you allow FIL to select the memory representation that is likely to offer the best mix of runtime performance and memory footprint, but if memory consumption is a problem, explicitly setting `storage_type` to `SPARSE` will ensure that a sparse representation is used. Alternatively, if you wish to maximize runtime performance regardless of memory considerations, you may try explicitly using a `DENSE` representation. In Example 4.1, we will explicitly set the `storage_type` to `SPARSE` and then back to `AUTO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you will not be able to observe a reduction in system GPU memory consumption (e.g. by using `nvidia-smi`) when adjusting these options, since all device memory allocations for FIL models come from Triton's pre-allocated memory pool. [^](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",

    "# FAQ 5: How do I submit an inference request to Triton?\n",
    "Triton supports both GRPC and HTTP requests, and you can use any GRPC/HTTP client to submit requests to Triton. In practice, however, it is often difficult to construct correct inference requests using a generic client, so Triton provides Python, Java, and C++ [clients](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client#client-library-apis) to make it easier to interact with the Triton server from each of those languages. For other languages, including [Go](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main/src/grpc_generated/go), [Scala](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main/src/grpc_generated/java), and [JavaScript](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main/src/grpc_generated/javascript), Triton provides a protoc compiler that can generate GRPC APIs for inclusion in your application. In this notebook, we will take a look solely at how to make use of the Python client for submitting inference requests. [^](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "## FAQ 5.1: How do I submit inference requests through Triton's C API?\n",
    "In addition to its use as an HTTP/GRPC server, Triton can be used as a library within another application using its C API. Example code for this use case with the FIL backend is under development and will be linked to once complete.\n",
    " [^](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "## FAQ 5.2: How do I submit inference requests with categorical variables?\n",
    "Triton accepts input as an array of floating-point values, rather than e.g. a dataframe. In order to accept categorical values, we must convert them to floating-point representations of the categorical codes used in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with most frameworks that accept categorical variables, a certain amount of care must be taken to ensure that the same categorical codes are used during inference as during training. For instance, if you trained your model using a dataframe with ten possible categorical values in a particular column, but the data you submit at inference time has only two of the ten possible values, Pandas/cuDF may assign different categorical codes from those used during training, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, it is important to keep some record of the categories used during training to correctly construct an input array. In this example, we will demonstrate how to convert categorical values to their floating point representation using the categorical codes provided by Pandas/cuDF. [^](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "## FAQ 5.3: Should I use any name besides `input__0` and `output__0` for inputs/outputs to the FIL backend?\n",
    "**No.** Unless you are using the FIL backend's Shapley value output feature (described later), the sole input array should *always* be named `input__0`, and the sole output array should *always* be named `output__0`. [^](#Table-of-Contents)"

However, inference with FIL is subject to floating point error, and the highly-parallel nature of FIL means that there may be slight differences in results between inference runs. If a confidence score is close to the decision threshold, this may even impact the output class reported for the model, so it is recommended to set `predict_proba` on if you are comparing model output on Triton vs. local execution.\n",

    "# FAQ 8: How do we measure performance of the FIL backend?\n",
    "For practical purposes, there are two numbers we generally care about when considering the performance of an inference server like Triton: **throughput** and **latency**. Throughput gives a measure of how many samples (rows) can be processed in a given interval, while latency gives a measure of how long a client will have to wait after sending a request before it receives a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your specific application, throughput or latency may have a higher or lower priority. Imagine that you are developing an application to analyze credit card transactions for potential fraud and stop suspected fraudulent transactions before they can go through. In such cases, latency is extremely important because a fraud/non-fraud determination must be made before a response can be sent to the point-of-sale. If the latency is too high, you may not be able to make a determination before the transaction has been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, imagine that you are developing an application to *retroactively* process all credit card transactions cleared in a day and look for fraudulent transactions that might already have occurred. In this case, throughput is the most important performance metric, since all we care about is the rate at which we can process the entire batch of daily transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another way of thinking about this tradeoff, latency generally determines the *responsiveness* of your application, while throughput determines the *compute cost*. With higher throughput, you will be able to process more total samples in a shorter period of time, which means that you can use fewer instances to handle required traffic. With lower latency, you will be able to quickly return responses, but you may need more instances to handle the volume of traffic you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FIL backend and Triton itself offer a range of configuration options to allow you to achieve exactly the right balance of throughput and latency for your application. We will go through a few of them in the following sections. For each option we consider, we will make use of Triton's `perf_analyzer` [tool](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/perf_analyzer.md#performance-analyzer) which allows us to measure latency and throughput with a variety of configuration options.

    "# FAQ 10: How fast is the FIL backend relative to alternatives?\n",
    "There are relatively few inference servers which offer support for tree-based models, so it is somewhat difficult to find a useful point of comparison. Sometimes, users ask for a comparison of the FIL backend's performance to e.g. native XGBoost performance, but because XGBoost does not offer an inference *serving* solution, it is very difficult to create an apples-to-apples comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do is compare the underlying FIL execution library directly to the underlying XGBoost library without invoking Triton as a server. In the following chart, we see this comparison for a fairly typical XGBoost model of moderate complexity. For this benchmark, GPU execution took place on a single A100 provided via a GCP a2 instance. CPU execution took place on a GCP n2-standard-16 instance.\n",
    "![Throughput%20vs%20Batch%20Size%20for%20XGBoost_FIL%20Only.png](attachment:Throughput%20vs%20Batch%20Size%20for%20XGBoost_FIL%20Only.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, FIL significantly outperforms CPU XGBoost at small batch sizes and more dramatically outperforms it on GPU for higher batch sizes. [^](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "## FAQ 10.1 How fast is the FIL backend on CPU vs on GPU?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, the answer to this question depends on the CPU and GPU hardware you have available. To give a sense of the typical performance differential one might expect, however, we present throughput-latency curves on CPU and GPU for a typical XGBoost model below. For this benchmark, GPU execution took place on a single A100 provided via a GCP a2 instance. CPU execution took place on a GCP n2-standard-16 instance.\n",
    "![Throughput%20vs%20p99%20Latency%20With%20Triton.png](attachment:Throughput%20vs%20p99%20Latency%20With%20Triton.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the very low latency domain (small batch size, light server traffic), we see that CPU execution can outperform GPU, but above around half a millisecond latency (slightly larger batches or increased traffic), GPU clearly dominates. [^](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "## FAQ 10.2 How fast is the FIL backend relative to the ONNX backend?\n",
    "\n",
    "While analysis of the underlying library is a useful starting place for understanding the performance of the FIL backend, it does not provide an entirely satisfactory point of comparison, since it does not provide a direct comparison of latency/throughput achievable on FIL vs another solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Triton does offer one other backend that supports *some* tree-based models, however. Using ONNX, we can get a more direct sense of how the FIL backend performs in an end-to-end comparison. In example 10, we will compare performance of a Scikit-Learn model when deployed with the FIL backend to the same model deployed with the ONNX backend and demonstrate that the FIL backend generally significantly outperforms ONNX on GPU.

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <b>NOTE:</b> We have restricted the following example to GPU execution because the relative CPU performance of ONNX vs FIL varies on a wide enough range of factors to make it difficult to draw generally-applicable conclusions. This topic will be covered separately elsewhere. CPU optimizations continue to be a focus for FIL backend development, and we expect its performance to continue to improve in areas where it currently underperforms the ONNX backend.

    "For this example, we will abandon our current example model and instead train up a Scikit-Learn RandomForestClassifier. This model can be converted to ONNX using the skl2onnx package. While *some* XGBoost models can also be converted to ONNX in a similar way, there is often difficulty with matching versions of each of the relevant packages, so we will stick to Scikit-Learn for the moment. We will then deploy the model using both the FIL and ONNX backends and compare their performance using `perf_analyzer`.\n",
