# Repo Overview

The FIL backend repo is organized in the following directories:

## `ci`
This directory contains scripts and configuration files for working with CI.
Developers may invoke `ci/local/build.sh` to build and run tests locally or
`ci/gitlab/build.sh` to more precisely mirror the test environment run in
official CI. This directory is not intended for end users.

## `cmake`
This directory contains CMake files required for the build, especially those
which are used to retrieve external dependencies. It is not intended for
end users.

## `conda`
This directory contains conda-related infrastructure including environment yaml
files used to construct build and test environments:

- `conda/environments/buildpy.yml`: Minimal environment for using Triton's
  `build.py` build script
- `conda/environments/rapids_triton_dev.yml`: Environment for building the FIL
  backend
- `conda/environments/triton_benchmark.yml`: Environment for running the FIL
  backend's standard benchmarks
- `conda/environments/triton_test_no_client.yml`: Environment for running tests
  for the FIL backend. This file does not include Triton's Python client to
  facilitate testing on ARM machines, where the client cannot be correctly
  installed via pip.
- `conda/environments/triton_test.yml`: Environment for running tests for the
  FIL backend that includes Triton's Python client. Recommended environment for
  those wishing to run tests outside of Docker.

## `docs`
This directory contains markdown files for documentation.

## `notebooks`
This directory contains example Jupyter notebooks for using the FIL backend.

## `ops`
This directory contains files used for build-related tasks including the
Dockerfile for the FIL backend's dockerized build. It is not intended for end
users.

## `qa`
This directory contains files for running tests and benchmarks. It is not
intended for end users.

## `scripts`
This directory contains utility scripts for e.g. converting models to Treelite
checkpoint format. It also contains a conda environment file indicating the
necessary dependencies for running these scripts.

## `src`
This directory contains the C++ source files for the FIL backend. It is not
intended for end users.
