# Model Support and Limitations
The FIL backend is designed to accelerate inference for **tree-based models**.
If the model you are trying to deploy is not tree-based, consider using one of
Triton's other backends.

## Frameworks
The FIL backend supports most XGBoost and LightGBM models using their native
serialization formats. The FIL backend also supports the following model types
from [Scikit-Learn and cuML](docs/sklearn_and_cuml.md) using Treelite's checkpoint serialization format:

- GradientBoostingClassifier
- GradientBoostingRegressor
- IsolationForest
- RandomForestRegressor
- ExtraTreesClassifier
- ExtraTreesRegressor

In addition, the FIL backend can perform inference on tree models from any
framework if they are first exported to Treelite's checkpoint serialization
format.

## Serialization Formats
The FIL backend currently supports the following serialization formats:

- XGBoost JSON (Version < 1.7)
- XGBoost Binary
- LightGBM Text
- Treelite binary checkpoint

The FIL backend does **not** support direct ingestion of Pickle files. The
pickled model must be converted to one of the above formats before it can be
used in Triton.

## Version Compatibility
Until version 3.0 of Treelite, Treelite offered no backward compatibility
for its checkpoint format even among minor releases. Therefore, the version
of Treelite used to save a checkpoint had to exactly match the version used in
the FIL backend. Starting with version 3.0, Treelite supports checkpoint
output from any version of Treelite starting with 2.7 until the next major
release.

XGBoost's JSON format also changes periodically between minor versions, and
older versions of Treelite used in the FIL backend may not support those
changes.

The compatibility matrix for Treelite and XGBoost with the FIL backend is
shown below:

| Triton Version | Supported Treelite Version(s) | Supported XGBoost JSON Version(s) |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 21.08          | 1.3.0                         | <1.6                              |
| 21.09-21.10    | 2.0.0                         | <1.6                              |
| 21.11-22.02    | 2.1.0                         | <1.6                              |
| 22.03-22.06    | 2.3.0                         | <1.6                              |
| 22.07          | 2.4.0                         | <1.7                              |
| 22.08-24.02    | 2.4.0; >=3.0.0,<4.0.0         | <1.7                              |
| 24.03+         | 3.9.0; >=4.0.0,<5.0.0         | 1.7+                              |

## Limitations
The FIL backend currently does not support any multi-output regression models.

## Double-Precision Support
While the FIL backend can load double-precision models, it performs all
computations in single-precision mode. This can lead to slight differences in
model output for frameworks like LightGBM which natively use double precision.
Support for double-precision execution is planned for an upcoming release.

## Categorical Feature Support
As of version 21.11, the FIL backend includes support for models with
categorical features (e.g. some
[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/categorical.html) and [LightGBM ](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Advanced-Topics.html#categorical-feature-support)) models.
These models can be deployed just like any other model, but it is worth
remembering that (as with any other inference pipeline which includes
categorical features), care must be taken to ensure that the categorical
encoding used during inference matches that used during training. If the data
passed through at inference time does not contain all of the categories used
during training, there is no way to reconstruct the correct mapping of
features, so some record must be made of the complete set of categories used
during training. With that record, categorical columns can be appropriately
converted to float32 columns, and submitted to Triton as with any other input.

For a fully-worked example of using a model with categorical features, check
out the [introductory fraud detection notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/triton-inference-server/fil_backend/blob/main/notebooks/categorical-fraud-detection/Fraud_Detection_Example.ipynb).
